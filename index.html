</div>
<div class="col-lg-6">
<p>Over 5 years ago we launched our advertising agency during what was an economically challenging time. We worked primarily in the music and publishing industries. It was then that we began focusing on helping small to medium-sized businesses develop their branding and messaging strategies as well as their creative advertising campaigns. As entrepreneurs, we understood first-hand what it meant to get a business off the ground, make a payroll and grow a business. Thus, we were uniquely qualified to help other businesses do the same.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves in staying in constant communication with our clients, meeting deadlines and staying within budget. There are no surprises for our clients—except the increased ROI they attain through an effective ad campaign.</p>
<p>We are very fortunate to make a living at doing what we love. We never look at the clock except to wish there was more time in the day to do more creative work. Hopefully, we’ll never take our good fortune for granted and look forward to what tomorrow brings.</p>
